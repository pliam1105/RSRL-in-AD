# RSRL in AD
 ## Applying Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving and evaluating possible and current approaches.

 The deliverables consist of two articles, part 1 (current state & approaches), and part 2 (implementation & results):

 ### Article Part 1: [RSRL in AD, part 1](https://medium.com/@pliam1105/risk-sensitive-reinforcement-learning-with-applications-in-autonomous-driving-part-1-93eebad62823)

 ### Article Part 2: [RSRL in AD, part 2](https://medium.com/@pliam1105/risk-sensitive-reinforcement-learning-with-applications-in-autonomous-driving-part-2-1b8e1f865e5a)

 The current repository also contains all the code implemented and the results acquired from the experiments.
